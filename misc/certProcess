An Issuer object is a yaml file that defines a 
certificate authority 

A Certificate object is a yaml file which represents 
the acutal certificate that we need. 


Once we deploy a new certificate object, cert manger will
automate the process an generate a kubernetes secret the 
will attach to our ingress controller, this secret will 
represent our certificate, and enable our clients to
connect to our server over tls. 


you can use "kubectl describe certificate <cert-name>" to 
see the status of your certificate.

once your certificate has been created, you can view it
under the secrets resource. :
